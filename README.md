# Mobile application of research laboratory using ReactNative
  As we know, each faculty is made up of departments that bring together all the college teachers. The department is headed by a head of department who coordinates scientific and educational activities and communicates with the Deanship.

  The Head of Department is also responsible for creating a group of Teams which includes 5 members and Labs which includes 12 members.

  The head of department assigns a leader to each team and laboratory, who in turn creates teams led by a member designated by the head of laboratory to work on the implementation of teaching and research programs, articles, special scientific activities, publications and studies.

  On the other hand, if the department is a little bigger, and the head of department wants to create new teams or add new members, he will have to move around and search for the files which may be too numerous so he will try to facilitate the mission and save time (account management, research structures, etc.).

  The head of department wants to be able to see new labs and teams in real time.

  This feature is specifically used on a large screen called "Dashboard" in an admin page, to see new or outgoing members who have been deleted. During this report:
  * We will describe the use of different technologies to address this issue.
  * The idea behind this is to see the limitations/benefits.

The well-designed mobile app can perform actions much faster than a mobile website.

Applications generally store their data locally on mobile devices, unlike websites which generally use web servers. For this reason, data recovery is done quickly in mobile apps.

Apps can still save users time by storing preferences and using them to take proactive action on users' behalf.
